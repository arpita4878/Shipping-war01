## 📌 Overview

In many countries, small and medium enterprises (SMEs/MSMEs) face inefficiencies in freight booking. Manual processes, lack of bidding options, and unclear pricing dominate traditional logistics procurement.  
This web application introduces **real-time freight auctions**, enabling both **forward and reverse bidding** to create a **smart logistics procurement system**.

---

## 🎯 Objective

- Create a **digital freight procurement platform**.
- Allow clients to **list logistics requirements** (loads).
- Enable **transporters to place competitive bids** on loads.
- Support **spot bookings** over long-term contracts.
- Ensure **transparency**, **cost savings**, and **streamlined logistics** operations.

---

## ✨ Key Features

- 🔄 **Reverse Auction System**  
  Transporters bid on listed loads; the lowest suitable bidder wins the job.

- 📦 **Freight Posting**  
  Clients can post shipment details including origin, destination, load type, and expected timeline.

- 🚛 **Bid Management**  
  Transporters can view active listings and place real-time bids.

- 📊 **Admin Panel**  
  For managing users, verifying bids, and generating reports.

- 📈 **Reports & Analytics**  
  Visualize cost savings, bids over time, and shipment history.
